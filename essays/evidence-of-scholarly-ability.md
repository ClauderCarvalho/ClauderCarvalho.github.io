As power grids transition from a centralized distribution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability 
requires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization. As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we 
designed and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and an open source cloud-based aggregation and 
visualization system built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage a flexible privacy model combined 
with inexpensive and easy to use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality monitoring network across the
Hawaiian islands. In this paper we describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization along with results of 
a small scale deployment of our prototype PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate that OPQ can 
provide useful power quality data at an order of magnitude less cost than prior approaches.

My specific contributions to this paper involve the discussions on privacy, visualizations, and sofwtware development.

Power quality issues can be caused in a variety of situations. Voltage fluctuations, frequency fluctuations, and 
harmonics are all power quality issues which can be caused by weather, high penetration of renewables, man-made issues, 
or other natural phenomena. We designed a software framework which can aggregate crowdsourced distributed power quality 
measurements in order to study power quality issues over a dense geographic area.
